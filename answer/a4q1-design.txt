Design:
Inital Ideas:
Latin Square as a list of lists. 
Square = [[]1,[]2,...[]N], len(Main) = N
Row = [#1, #2, ..., #N], len(Row) = N
Check rows and columns (not diagonals).
Easy to iterate over rows/columns.
Order does not matter.
Compare with [True]*N where each number in col/row sets slice false (sieve of something-esque).
Check this list to see if it contains any True values, if True not a Latin square.

def_checkrow(Main):
Purpose: To check each row in the list of lists to see if its a latin square.
Pre-conditions: A list of lists with N sublists of N length.
Return: True if Latin SQ, False otherwise.
- take a list of lists
- iterate through each sublist checking with [True]*N
- if [] have any True value then False, otherwise True

def_checkcol(Main):
Purpose: To check each column in the list of lists to see if its a latin square.
Pre-conditions: A list of lists with N sublists of N length.
Return: True if Latin SQ, False otherwise.
- take a list of lists
- iterate through each column checking with [True]*N in loop
   - requires each slice of row at same value for every sublist
- if [] have any True value then False, otherwise True

def_checker(Main):
Purpose: To check the square is a latin square with checkrow/checkcol.
Pre-conditions: A list of lists with N sublists of N length. Function checkrow and checkcol.
Post-conditons: Return values from checkrow and checkcol.
Return: Prints Yes if Latin SQ, No if not.
- use subfunctions to check and print result

def_open(filename):
Purpose: To open the file with the filename
Pre-conditions: A filename as a string
Post-conditons: File is read and creates a list of lists.
Return: A list of lists with N sublists of N length.
- open, strip, split
- set sublists
- append into main list

def_ask(filename):
Purpose: Asks for the name of a file from console using input.
Pre-conditions: The filename is written correctly.
Post-conditons: The filename is a string.
Return: A filename set as a string.
- ask for input
- make sure input is a string
