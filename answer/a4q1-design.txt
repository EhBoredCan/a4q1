Design:
Inital Ideas:
Latin Square as a list of lists. 
Square = [[]1,[]2,...[]N], len(Main) = N
Row = [#1, #2, ..., #N], len(Row) = N
Check rows and columns (not diagonals).
Easy to iterate over rows/columns.
Order does not matter.
Compare with [True]*N where each number in col/row sets slice false (sieve of something-esque).
Check this list to see if it contains any True values, if True not a Latin square.

def_checkrow(Main, N):
Purpose: To check each row in the list of lists to see if its a latin square.
Pre-conditions: A list of lists with N sublists of N length. N.
Return: True if Latin SQ, False otherwise.
- take a list of lists
- iterate through each sublist checking with [True]*N
- if [] have any True value then False, otherwise True

Black Box:
Return correct Boolean value considering input
   - correct lists
   - incorrect list
      - not latin
      - size

def_checkcol(Main, N):
Purpose: To check each column in the list of lists to see if its a latin square.
Pre-conditions: A list of lists with N sublists of N length. N.
Return: True if Latin SQ, False otherwise.
- take a list of lists
- iterate through each column checking with [True]*N in loop
   - requires each slice of row at same value for every sublist
- if [] have any True value then False, otherwise True

Black Box:
Return correct Boolean value considering input
   - correct lists
   - incorrect list
      - not latin
      - size

def_checker(Main, N):
Purpose: To check the square is a latin square with checkrow/checkcol.
Pre-conditions: A list of lists with N sublists of N length. Function checkrow and checkcol exist. N.
Post-conditons: Return values from checkrow and checkcol.
Return: Prints Yes if Latin SQ, No if not.
- use subfunctions to check and print result

Black Box:
Visual Inspection: Prints the correct result depending on input

def_open(filename):
Purpose: To open the file with the filename
Pre-conditions: A filename as a string
Post-conditons: File is read and creates a list of lists of integers.
Return: A list of lists with N sublists of N length, The value of N.
- open, strip, split
- set sublists
- append into main list

Black Box:
Return correct list of lists
   - size, length
   - no missing values
Return correct value of N
Values in list are integers

def_ask(filename):
Purpose: Asks for the name of a file from console using input.
Pre-conditions: The filename is written correctly.
Post-conditons: The filename is a string.
Return: A filename set as a string.
- ask for input
- make sure input is a string 

Black Box:
Return a string of input
Visual inspection: Does it ask for an input
